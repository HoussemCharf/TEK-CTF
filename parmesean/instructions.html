<h3>YAY! you finally noticed it took you sometime baka -_____-</h3><br \>
<p>
so basically you are required to solve the this puzzle in order for you to get to the cheesy flag!
for you to reach it you need to follow the map (instructions) hidden by Lenny => ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)<br \>

The instructions indicates that you should start at your current position
face North. Then, follow the steps:<br \><br \>

Either turn left (L) or right (R) 90 degrees, then walk forward the given<br \>
number of blocks, ending at a new point.<br \><br \>


There's no time to follow such ridiculous instructions to be honest, so i suggest
take a moment and work out the destination. Given that you can only walk on<br \>
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry">street grid of the city</a>, how far is the shortest path to the destination?<br \><br \><br \>


Examples:<br \><br \>

case1: R2, L3 the correct answer would be 5<br \> <br \><br \>

case2: R2, R2, R2 leaves you 2 blocks South of your starting position,which makes the shortest path 2.<br \> <br \><br \>


to submit your destination you need to forward a get request to / with param attemp<br \>
