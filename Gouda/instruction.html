<h3>Hello there!</h3>
<p>i heard you are looking for the flag! well good news i found it but before i hand it to you i need a favor. i have a serious cable issue that needs to be resolved and i would really appreciate the help!
<br>so basically i have <b>two</b> cables on a board starting from the central port [O]. i am pretty positive that there is a short circuit happening at the <b>closest intersection of those two from the starting port</b>
<br>your job is to find the shortest path for me to follow on the board to reach this intersection from the central port. don't worry i have a detailed description on how the 2 cables are deployed on the board

<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>Example:
<br>
<br>
<br>if the first cable's path is R8 U5 L5 D3. this means that the cable goes right 8 -> up 5, left 5, and lastly down 3:
<br><code>
...........
<br>...........
<br>...........
<br>....+----+.
<br>....|....|.
<br>....|....|.
<br>....|....|.
<br>.........|.
<br>.o-------+.
<br>...........
</code>
<br>let's assume the seconde cable will follow U7 R6 D4 L4. this will result in the this structure.
<br><code>
    <br>...........
    <br>.+-----+...
    <br>.|.....|...
    <br>.|..+--X-+.
    <br>.|..|..|.|.
    <br>.|.-X--+.|.
    <br>.|..|....|.
    <br>.|.......|.
    <br>.o-------+.
    <br>...........
</code><br><br><br><br><br>
<br>the intersection is 3 blocks away!
